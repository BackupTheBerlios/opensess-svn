Installing OpenSess
===================

Just create a directory and unpack the contents of
opensess-win-XX.XX.zip (where "XX.XX" is the release number) into it.
You can then start OpenSess by double-clicking "OpenSess.exe" in the
explorer. Alternatively, you can start "OpenSessConsole.exe" which
also starts a console window, where any error messages will be displayed.

Uninstalling OpenSess
=====================

Just delete the directory where you unpacked the OpenSess files.

Requirements
============

You must have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. 
OpenSess was tested with J2SE v1.5.0.
