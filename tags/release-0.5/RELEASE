Release Notes for OpenSess 0.5
==============================

This is the first official release of OpenSess, a program that 
helps you to organize discussion of various topics in parallel 
sessions where the participants have different preferences for 
individual topics and can play several roles.
It is still something of a pre-release since at the moment
the program produces as many solutions as you want, but does
not help you much in selecting the best solution.
As soon as we have implemented an automatic selection of
the best solutions, OpenSess 1.0 will be released.

TO DO
=====

- Automatic selection of best solutions.
- Visualize how well or how badly individual participants
  are treated by a particular solution.
- Improve documentation.
