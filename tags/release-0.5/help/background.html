    <h1>Background</h1>

    <p>OpenSess is used to organize discussions when there are various
      topic, and the participants have varying preferences for the 
      individual topics.
    </p>

    <p>Imagine a group of people that meets to exchange and generate ideas,
      discuss them, and maybe even make one or two decisions about them.
      There is probably a single common reason for the meeting, but it
      might make sense to break down this "root topic" into individual
      "sub topics" and discuss them separately. There is no reason for
      everyone to attend all discussions and in particular, nobody wants
      to attend a discussion that he or she is not at all interested in.
      This results in smaller groups that can work more efficiently
      compared to discussion everything in the big group.
      If some of the discussions could take place in parallel, it might
      speed up the entire discussion (and maybe decision) process 
      considerably.
    </p>

    <p>This leaves us with the big question: Which topics should be
      discussed in parallel and how should people distribute themselves
      between the discussion sessions?
    </p>

    <p>This question has been asked before and there have been several
      attempts to answer them. The suggested strategies range from
      almost complete freedom (for example the OpenSpace method
      described at www.openspaceworld.org) to very rigid organisational
      schemes that work only for certain numbers of people and topics
      (for example the Syntegrity method described at www.syntegrity.com).
    </p>

    <p>OpenSess tends towards the more strongly structured methods in that
      it attempts to find nearly optimal topic clusterings and participant
      distributions. However, it has only a few rules regarding the
      numbers of participants and topics and it incorporates the 
      preferences that participants have for certain topics.
      In particular, the OpenSess method depends on the following 
      concepts and constraints:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The number of <em>sessions</em> that can take place in parallel.
          This will usually be determined by some "real world constraint"
          like the number of available rooms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The number of <em>roles</em> that participants can have in a session.
          Typical roles are "moderator", "critic" or "observer".
          OpenSess currently allocates an equal number of participants to
          each role so you will have as many moderators as critics and 
          observers. This might change in a later release of OpenSess.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The number of <em>participants</em> that attend the meeting.
          The algorithm currently used by OpenSess demands that
          the number of participants must be divisible by the product 
          of the number of sessions and the number of roles.
          Later versions of OpenSess will probably relax that constraint.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The number of <em>topics</em> that are to be discussed in the
          individual sessions. This number is related to the number of
          <em>rounds</em> that are neccessary to discuss all topics
          when each round is a set of parallel sessions. In other words,
          you can either fix the number of rounds which means that you will 
          have <em>rounds*sessions</em> topics, or you can start with
          a fixed number of topics, which means that you will have
          <em>topics/sessions</em> rounds.
          In addition, the number of topics must also be divisible by 
          the product of the number of sessions and the number of roles
          (and that constraint might also be relaxed in the future).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The roles are maintained in a list in which the roles are sorted
      by "strength" or "importance", so that there is a "strongest role"
      and a "weakest role".
    </p>

    <p>Each participant also has a <em>preference list</em> which contains
      every topic exactly once. The first topic in the list is the most
      important topic for the participant and the last topic is the topic
      of least interest. OpenSess will try to find configurations in which
      participants can attend the sessions that are most interesting for them
      and it will also try to give them the "strongest" role available.
      In fact, solutions will be judged by how well the interests of the
      participants are met.
    </p>

    <p>Each <em>solution</em> produced by OpenSess will consist of the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The clustering of topics into rounds of sessions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The assignment of participants to sessions and the roles
          that they have in each session.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Several statistical values that evaluate how well the solution
          meets the interests of the participants.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Currently OpenSess produces an arbitrary number of solutions and
      it is the user's task to choose the one he or she considers best.
      Later versions of OpenSess will try to better support the user
      in this task.
