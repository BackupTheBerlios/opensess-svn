    <h1>Getting started</h1>
    
    <p>OpenSess starts with an initial configuration for 12 participants,
      12 topics, 3 roles and 2 parallel sessions. If this is not what you
      need, you should use "File/New" first to enter a new configuration.
      When you press "Create" in the configuration window, the MainWindow
      will be reconfigured (provided that your configuration numbers
      do not violate any of the divisibilty rules).
    </p>

    <p>Although the names of participants, topics and roles do not influence
      the solution calculation at all, it is a good idea to enter the
      names first because it helps you to enter the topic preferences,
      which <em>do</em> influence the calculation. Entering the names is
      very similar for participants, topics, and roles: Just press the
      "Edit" button under the relevant list which opens a new window which
      shows an editable version of the name selected in the main window.
      Double-clicking on a name in the main window has the same effect.
      You can change the name to anything you like. As soon as you click
      anywhere outside the text entry field, the name will be updated
      wherever it is visible in OpenSess. If instead, you press the
      enter key, the name will be updated <em>and</em> the next name in 
      the list will be selected in the edit window. This way, you can 
      change all the names in the list very quickly by alternately
      entering names and pressing the enter key.
      You can also navigate to another name in the list either by selecting it
      from the drop-down list at the top of the edit window or by 
      using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
    </p>

    <p>The window for editing participant data is a little different from
      the other edit windows sinsce it also contains the list of preferences
      for the selected participant. In this list, every topic appears
      exactly once. The topic of most interest to the selected participant
      should be at the top. If it isn't, click on the topic at the top.
      A drop-down list of all topics appears. Select the topic that
      <em>should</em> be at the top. The list will now be update to
      show that topic at the top. The topic that used to be at the top
      will now appear wherever the most important topic used to be in the
      list before (which means that the two topics were swapped).
      In the same way, bring the second-most interesting topic into
      position two and so forth until the list reflects the interests
      of the selected person.
    </p>

    <p>You can have all edit windows open at the same time and switch
      back and forth between them as you like. When you change the
      name of a topic for example, it will also be changed in the 
      main window and the preference list of the participant window.
    </p>

    <p>You are now ready to calculate some solutions.
      Check the calculation parameters near the bottom right of the main
      window, make any neccessary adjustments and press "Solve".
      The calculation starts in a background thread (which means that
      you can actually change names whiles a calculation is progressing).
      If it is a lengthy calculation, a progress window will appear
      which gives you some feedback of what is going on.
      Any solution found during the calculation will appear in the
      solution list. The solutions are given initial names of the form
      "Solution &lt;n&gt;: &lt;meandev&gt; - &lt;maxdev&gt; - &lt;stddev&gt;"
      where "n" is the solution number, "meandev" the mean deviation,
      "maxdev" the maximum deviation and "stddev" the standard deviation.
      You can use these values to pick a solution that interests you.
      You can look at any interesting solution in the solution
      window either
      by selecting it in the list and pressing the "Show" button or simply
      by double-clicking the solution in the list.
    </p>

    <p>The solution window works exactly like the edit windows:
      you can give other names to the solutions and you can navigate to other
      solutions using the drop-down list or the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
      Otherwise the window gives you three different views on the
      solution:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The "Statistics" panel shows the statistical evaluation of the
          solution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The "Topic Clustering" panel shows how topics are clustered into
          parallel sessions by this solution. The session rounds are color
          coded to give you a reference for the same color coding in the
          "Role Assignment" panel.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The "Role Assignment" panel shows you who should attend which session
          and what role the participant should have.
          Topics in the same session round have the same color so that you can
          easily see what is happening in parallel.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
